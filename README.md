SMART HEALTH HACKATHON PRAGUE - Image capturing hardware and an Android app that stores images of patient's feet and stores information about ulcerâ€™s severity 


The main reason for amputations is late onset of diabetic complications in form of diabetic ulcers (DU). DU represents a major medical, social, and economic problem in patients with diabetes all over the world. Average annual expenses of diabetic foot care are US$8659 per patient, whereas US$9 to US$13 billion is spent yearly for medical costs of diabetic foot disease management in United States alone Preventing the development of DU in patients with diabetes reduces the frequency of lower extremity amputations by 49.85%. 

During the course of hackathon we have developed a fully functional Android app and pieces of functional hardware. We also developed Matlab image processing algorithm for better visualisation of images captured with smartpone.
